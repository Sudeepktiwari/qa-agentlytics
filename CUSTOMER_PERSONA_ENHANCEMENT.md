# 🎯 Customer Persona-Based Followups Enhancement

## Overview

Enhance the chatbot's proactive messaging system to incorporate customer persona data extracted during website crawling, creating hyper-personalized conversations that significantly improve conversion rates.

## Current State vs Enhanced State

### **Current System** ✅

- Content-based messaging (pricing page → pricing help)
- Intent detection from URL patterns
- Dynamic button generation
- Under 30-word messages

### **Enhanced System** 🚀

- **Persona-aware messaging** (pricing page + SaaS startup → growth-focused options)
- **Industry-specific recommendations**
- **Company size considerations**
- **Use case matching**
- **Buying journey positioning**

## How Customer Personas Would Be Created

### **1. Website Content Analysis During Crawling**

When crawling a website, extract:

```javascript
// Example persona extraction from website content
const personaData = {
  targetCustomers: [
    {
      type: "small_business",
      industries: ["retail", "restaurants", "services"],
      painPoints: ["limited budget", "simple setup", "quick ROI"],
      features: [
        "basic scheduling",
        "customer notifications",
        "simple integrations",
      ],
    },
    {
      type: "enterprise",
      industries: ["technology", "healthcare", "finance"],
      painPoints: ["complex workflows", "security compliance", "scalability"],
      features: [
        "advanced analytics",
        "SSO",
        "custom integrations",
        "dedicated support",
      ],
    },
  ],
  commonUseCases: [
    "appointment scheduling for service businesses",
    "team coordination for remote companies",
    "client meetings for consultancies",
  ],
  competitorMentions: ["calendly", "acuity", "bookly"],
  pricingStrategy: "freemium_with_paid_tiers",
};
```

### **2. Intelligent Persona Detection During Chat**

Analyze user behavior and responses to identify their persona:

```javascript
// Real-time persona detection
const detectUserPersona = (conversationHistory, pageActivity) => {
  const signals = {
    companySize: extractCompanySize(conversationHistory),
    industry: detectIndustry(conversationHistory),
    painPoints: identifyPainPoints(conversationHistory),
    urgency: assessBuyingUrgency(pageActivity),
    technicalLevel: evaluateTechnicalExpertise(conversationHistory),
  };

  return matchToPersona(signals, websitePersonaData);
};
```

## Enhanced Followup Examples

### **Current Followup**

```javascript
// Generic pricing page followup
{
  "mainText": "Questions about pricing? I can walk you through the options.",
  "buttons": ["Compare Plans", "Get Quote", "Talk to Sales"]
}
```

### **Persona-Enhanced Followup**

```javascript
// Small business owner on pricing page
{
  "mainText": "Running a service business? Our Starter plan handles 80% of what most local businesses need for $12/month.",
  "buttons": ["See Starter Features", "Compare to Basic", "Try Free Demo"],
  "persona": "small_business",
  "reasoningContext": "User visited pricing after reading about appointment scheduling for service businesses"
}

// Enterprise buyer on pricing page
{
  "mainText": "Need enterprise features? Let's discuss volume pricing and custom integrations for your team size.",
  "buttons": ["Enterprise Demo", "Volume Pricing", "Security Overview"],
  "persona": "enterprise",
  "reasoningContext": "User spent time on security docs and team management features"
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### **1. Enhance Crawling Process**

```typescript
// Add to existing crawling system
interface PersonaData {
  targetAudiences: CustomerPersona[];
  industryFocus: string[];
  useCaseExamples: UseCase[];
  competitorLandscape: CompetitorData[];
  pricingStrategy: PricingStrategy;
}

const extractPersonaData = async (
  websiteContent: string[]
): Promise<PersonaData> => {
  // Use GPT-4 to analyze content and extract persona data
  const prompt = `
    Analyze this website content and extract customer persona data:
    - Who are the target customers? (company size, industry, role)
    - What are their main pain points and use cases?
    - What features matter most to each persona?
    - How does pricing align with customer segments?
    
    Content: ${websiteContent.join("\n")}
  `;

  const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
  });

  return JSON.parse(analysis.choices[0].message.content);
};
```

### **2. Enhance Chat Route with Persona Logic**

```typescript
// Add to existing route.ts
const generatePersonaBasedFollowup = async (
  pageContext: string,
  detectedPersona: CustomerPersona,
  conversationHistory: string,
  currentPage: string
) => {
  const systemPrompt = `
    Generate a followup message for a ${
      detectedPersona.type
    } customer viewing ${currentPage}.
    
    Customer Profile:
    - Company Size: ${detectedPersona.companySize}
    - Industry: ${detectedPersona.industry}
    - Main Pain Points: ${detectedPersona.painPoints.join(", ")}
    - Preferred Features: ${detectedPersona.preferredFeatures.join(", ")}
    
    Be specific to their persona needs. Reference relevant use cases for their industry/size.
    Keep under 30 words but make it highly relevant to their specific situation.
  `;

  // Generate persona-specific response
};
```

### **3. Persona Detection Algorithm**

```typescript
const detectPersonaFromConversation = (
  messages: ChatMessage[],
  pageVisitPattern: string[],
  timeSpentOnPages: Record<string, number>
): CustomerPersona => {
  const signals = {
    // Company size indicators
    mentionsTeam: messages.some((m) => /team|staff|employees/i.test(m.content)),
    mentionsEnterprise: messages.some((m) =>
      /enterprise|corporation|department/i.test(m.content)
    ),

    // Budget sensitivity
    asksPricing: messages.some((m) =>
      /cost|price|budget|affordable/i.test(m.content)
    ),
    viewsEnterprisePage: pageVisitPattern.includes("/enterprise"),

    // Technical level
    asksTechnical: messages.some((m) =>
      /api|integration|webhook|sso/i.test(m.content)
    ),
    viewsDocsPages: pageVisitPattern.some((page) => page.includes("/docs")),

    // Urgency level
    quickPageVisits: timeSpentOnPages.pricing < 30,
    requestsDemo: messages.some((m) => /demo|trial|test/i.test(m.content)),
  };

  // Match signals to persona profiles
  return matchSignalsToPersona(signals);
};
```

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **1. Automatic Persona Extraction**

When you crawl your website, the system automatically:

- Analyzes all crawled content using GPT-4
- Identifies 2-4 distinct customer personas
- Extracts pain points, preferred features, and buying patterns
- Stores personas linked to your admin account

### **2. Real-Time Persona Detection**

During live chats, the system analyzes:

- **Language patterns:** "our team" vs "just me" vs "enterprise"
- **Technical level:** API mentions vs business language
- **Budget signals:** "affordable", "enterprise pricing", budget discussions
- **Urgency indicators:** "urgent", "exploring", "deadline"
- **Page behavior:** Which pages visited, time spent
- **Decision authority:** "I need to check with my team" vs "let's do this"

### **3. Persona-Specific Responses**

Once a persona is detected, followups become:

- **Highly targeted:** Addresses specific persona pain points
- **Appropriately technical:** Matches their technical sophistication
- **Budget-aware:** Considers their likely budget range
- **Urgency-matched:** Reflects their decision timeline
- **Role-appropriate:** Speaks to decision makers vs researchers differently

2. **Detect user personas** in real-time during conversations
3. **Generate targeted followups** that speak directly to each persona type
4. **Continuously learn** from conversation patterns to improve detection
5. **🆕 Preserve engagement during tab switching** - followup timers continue even when page is hidden
6. **🆕 Accelerated re-engagement** - faster followups (5-8s) when users return to the page

### **🚀 Advanced Lead Generation Features**

**Page Visibility Intelligence:**

- **Uninterrupted Engagement:** Followup timers continue running when users switch tabs
- **Smart Re-engagement:** Accelerated followups when users return (5-8s vs normal 12-30s)
- **No Lost Opportunities:** Maintain lead nurturing even during multitasking
